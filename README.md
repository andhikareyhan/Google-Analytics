WHAT IS GOOGLE ANALYTICS?
Google Analytics is one of the many Google Developer Products available for anyone to use. A common use for this product is to collect, configure, and analyze data from a website in order for you to reach the right audience. It is often utilized by online stores or businesses to get data on the people who visit their websites, which page has the most visits, which page is the ideal landing page for your website, and many more.

HOW TO USE GOOGLE ANALYTICS?
It's pretty simple. First, you must sign up for a Google Analytics account. In the process of doing so, you'll be able to link your website to the account so that every single data will be easily accessed from there. It's a pretty standard sign up process and it won't take too much of your time. It doesn't always have to be used for websites, but it could also be used for mobile apps and internet connected devices.

WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT GOOGLE ANALYTICS?
In my personal opinion, it does take some getting used to but once you do, it's a tool that will help you be more responsive to users. Google Analytics allow you to integrate various data from different platforms using it's simple and powerful API. If you're stuck or want to start learning about Google Analytics, Google Academy offers an introductory course (which comes with an e-certificate) and an advanced level one. The course they offer is completely free of charge and worth to try.

Once you're done with the course and get to know the basics of this Google Developer Product, you can do any kind of analysis with it.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Developers interact with data and process these data through the Google Analytics UI, client libraries and APIs. The platform itself is divided into 4 components:
(1) Collection - collects user-interaction data
(2) Configuration - allows management of how you want to process the data
(3) Processing - processes the user-interaction data with configuration data
(4) Reporting - provides developer access to the data
